A Numpy Neural Network library and much more
#########################

Introduction
============

A libray which focuses on intuitions and visualizations of neural networks implemented in raw numpy code.

Why it matters
============

1. A minimalist and intuitive API similar to pytorch and keras
2. Compare perfomace of different optimizers easily
3. Plot the hidden layers as weights effortlessly to visualize how image reocognition models work
4. Option to display the math to get a idea regarding the theory applied

The purpose of the workshop
---------------------------

**Don't be afraid to commit** will help put you in a position to commit
successfully to collaborative projects.

A standalone .css file (including necessary dropdown styles and alternative, text-based arrows) can be generated by running ``build/build_standalone.less`` through the ``lessc`` compiler::

    $ lessc build/build_standalone.less datepicker.css
