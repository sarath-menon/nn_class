Introduction
============

A workshop/tutorial for Python/Django developers who would like to contribute
more to the projects they use, but need more grounding in some of the tools
required.

The workshop will take participants through the complete cycle of identifying a simple issue in a
Django or Python project, writing a patch with documentation, and submitting it.

The purpose of the workshop
---------------------------

**Don't be afraid to commit** will help put you in a position to commit
successfully to collaborative projects.

You'll find it particularly useful if you think you have some good coding
ideas, but find that managing the development process sometimes gets in the
way of your actual development.
