Loss Functions
#########################

Introduction
============

In the previous section ,we talked about forward prop which takes in the data as input and outputs bullshit in early stages of trainig.Loss functions is the first step of actual 'Learning' in a neural network.**It measures the difference between the actual ouput given in the dataset and the wrong output and the neural network**.Based on how big the loss is ,we have to modify the parameters of the network so that the loss is minimised.

Why it matters
============

1. A minimalist and intuitive API similar to pytorch and keras
2. Compare perfomace of different optimizers easily
3. Plot the hidden layers as weights effortlessly to visualize how image reocognition models work
4. Option to display the math to get a idea regarding the theory applied
