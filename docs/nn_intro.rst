Neural networks aka deep learning
##############

The first step to understanding neural networks is to be clear about the terms Artificial Intelligence ,Machine learning and 
Deep learning. **AI** includes practically any techinique that *empowers a machine to take intelligent decisions 
without being expicitly programmed*. **Machine learning** resides within AI and refers specifically to a range of tools that promote *intelligence through learning* . **Deep learning** happens to be a part of machine learning that exploits *specific tools called* **Neural Networks** to make it work.


Before Deep learning
=====================

Deep learning now constitutes most of machine learning and both advancements and econimic value generated are growing exponentially ,but this was not always the case.Even in the last decade most of the ML community was concerened with several 
now obsolete techniques such as kNN ,SVM and random forests.But these techinques had several problems associated with them and
nobody could get it to work really well on any problem that mattered in real life.Let me demostrate them through two examples

 - **Problem 1 :** Consider that the problem is to classify male and female voice.Going by old Ml techniques ,the first step would be to find out among the general properties of sound such as frequeny ,amplitude ,bass etc one that of differentiates them the most ,which would be frequency in this case.Such Properties of
