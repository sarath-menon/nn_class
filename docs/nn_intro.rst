Neural networks aka deep learning
##############

The first step to understanding neural networks is to be clear about the terms Artificial Intelligence ,Machine learning and 
Deep learning. **AI** includes practically any techinique that *empowers a machine to take intelligent decisions 
without being expicitly programmed*. **Machine learning** resides within AI and refers specifically to a range of tools that 
allow machines to be *intelligent through learning* . **Deep learning** happens to be a part of machine learning that exploits *specific tools called* **Neural Networks** to make it work.

*	create a new Git branch
*	edit and commit a file on GitHub
*	make a pull request

**Git** is a source code management system, designed to support collaboration.

**GitHub** is a web-based service that hosts Git projects, including Django
itself: https://github.com/django/django.

The key idea in Git is that it's *distributed*. If you're not already familiar
with version control systems, then explaining why this is important will only
introduce distinctions and complications that you don't need to worry about,
so that's the last thing I will say on the subject.
