## Why it matters

A minimalist and intuitive API similar to pytorch and keras
Doesnâ€™t confuse the beginner by providing a long list of hyperparameter choices
Compare perfomace of different optimizers easily
Plot the hidden layers as weights effortlessly to visualize how image reocognition models work
Option to display the math to get a idea regarding the theory applied
